# Simple-Python-Chatbot

# TODO
* get logging to work
  * I need to see how the chat brain is parsing input.
  * I don't see any evidence in the code for recording what the users type
* bind chat bot to telegram or similar
* bind return key in UI to send user input
* set up a requirements document
* check for cyrillic support
* figure out a json UI 
  * It's really not convenient to work with json
  
# Questions
* Can we call a Python script from a json file?

Creating a simple Python chatbot using natural language processing and deep learning.

1. run the libraries.py first
Check your dependencies. A requirements file or poetry config would be useful here.

2. run train_chatbot

3. run chatgui.py


# misc
* convert_json_to_csv.py
I found this on the web and was hoping a csv file would be easier to edit than json. No such luck.
